PostFix Secure Mail Proxy

Gnu Proxy is a web frontend for the famous Postfix Mail Delivery System, written in Python (Flask micro-framework) used for building a secure SMTP Proxy server that acts as a gateway between your mail server and the internet providing varying levels of functionality, high security, depending on your use case, needs, or company policies.

The Postfix SMTP server receives mail from the network and is exposed to the big bad world of junk email and viruses. In a distant past, the Internet was a friendly environment. Mail servers happily forwarded mail on behalf of anyone towards any destination. On todayâ€™s Internet, spammers abuse servers that forward mail from arbitrary systems, and abused systems end up on anti-spammer denylists. GnuProxy is here to solve all this problems!
